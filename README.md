# ðŸ¤– TDS Virtual TA

This project is a **Virtual Teaching Assistant** designed for the *Tools in Data Science (TDS)* course offered by **IIT Madras' Online BSc in Data Science** program. It aims to reduce the workload of human TAs by automatically answering frequently asked student questions using course content and Discourse forum discussions.

The API accepts a natural language question (with optional image attachments) and responds with a concise answer. It also includes supporting links to relevant Discourse threads or course content when available. This system is powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT models and utilizes scraped data for grounding.

The application is built with **FastAPI** and exposes a public API endpoint that can be evaluated using PromptFoo. It takes in a question via a simple POST request and outputs an intelligent response. The backend includes a scraping component for fetching and processing data from the TDS Discourse forum between January and April 2025, which is used to guide the modelâ€™s answers.

This project has been structured with best practices, including modular APIs, utility functions, environmental configuration, and automated testing. Itâ€™s designed to be deployed easily on platforms like **Render** or exposed via **ngrok** during development. By combining scraping, NLP, and API design, this project serves as a valuable assistant to students navigating the TDS course.
